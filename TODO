Add option to partition data by percentage or by a specific number to hold out

Add option to generate training/test data from a function (e.g. MVN data)
  Use an iterator to make repeated calls to this function
  Repeat this B times

After the basic list of results is completed, add the option to save the results as other types.
  classify(..., results = c("list", "mysql", "data.frame"), ...)
  To do this, write these helper functions:
    results_as_data.frame()
    results_as_db()

Error Rate Estimators
  Move error rate estimators to R/error_rate.r
  Stub the code for everything but split

Refactor calculation of error rates
  Return multiple error rates?

Roxygen documentation

Add plot_classify() that plots avg_error and  boxplots of test error rates.
  Use plotting code from rlda-sim study.

Update README file to use markdown

Start building a wiki as documentation for classify
