Add unit test for model selection 
Add unit test for cross-validation

Add variable selection to classify() summary
  Include variable selection options in summary.
    Example:
      var_select = "ANOVA" 
      q = 30

Fix issue with error_cv
  The error returned for each fold is the proportion of misclassified.
  When these are summarized, the proportions are averaged.
  However, this reported number is incorrect when the fold count is imbalanced.
  Example: N = 31, k = 5. First 6 folds have 5 test obs, but last has one.

In var_select_anova
Add unit test for the case where q < 1
Add unit test for the case where q > p

Implement error_apparent()
Implement error_boot()
Implement error_632()
Implement error_632plus()

Add option to generate training/test data from a function (e.g. MVN data)
  Use an iterator to make repeated calls to this function
  Repeat this B times

Add the option to save results as other types.
  classify(..., results = c("list", "mysql", "data.frame"), ...)
  To do this, write these helper functions:
    results_as_data.frame()
    results_as_db()

Start building a wiki as documentation for classify

Add preprocessing options
  Normalize data
  Dimension reduction
  Others?

Store and show results for model selection
  Plot error rates as a function of tuning parameters.

Add diagnostic tools so that test observations that are continually
misclassified can be identified.
  Ex.: Bar graph with proportions that each observation is misclassified.
