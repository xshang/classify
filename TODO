Minimal classify() requirements
	Takes a list of data sets
		Each data set is provided as a list with x and y component
	Test error rates are determined with (repeated) partitioning as in rda sims
	Takes a list of classifiers (use only defaults at first)
		Each classifier has a list of options (do this after some basics are done)
	Returns
		List of test predictions for each partition
		Average test error rates and their standard errors

After the basic list of results is completed, add the option to save the results as other types.
	classify(..., results = c("list", "mysql", "data.frame"), ...)
	To do this, write these helper functions:
		results_as_data.frame()
		results_as_db()
